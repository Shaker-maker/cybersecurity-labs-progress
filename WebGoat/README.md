# WebGoat Labs 🐐

This section contains my hands-on notes and progress while working through **WebGoat**, an intentionally insecure web application maintained by OWASP.  
The goal is to practice exploiting common web vulnerabilities and documenting the lessons learned.

---

## 📚 Structure
Each folder inside `WebGoat/` corresponds to a lesson or category of lessons.  
For example:
- `Http-Proxies/` — Documentation of the HTTP Proxies lesson.
- `A1-Injection/` — SQL Injection and related labs.
- `A2-Broken-Authentication/` — Authentication-related labs.
- …and so on (mapped to OWASP Top 10 categories or WebGoat lessons).

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **OWASP ZAP** — to intercept, inspect, and modify HTTP traffic.  
- **WebGoat** (latest version) running locally in a Docker container.  
- **Kali Linux** as the working environment.

## ✅ Progress
- [x] HTTP Proxies  
- [ ] A1 – Injection  
- [ ] A2 – Broken Authentication  
- [ ] A3 – Sensitive Data Exposure  
- [ ] A4 – XML External Entities  
- [ ] A5 – Broken Access Control  
- [ ] A6 – Security Misconfiguration  
- [ ] A7 – Cross-Site Scripting  
- [ ] A8 – Insecure Deserialization  
- [ ] A9 – Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities  
- [ ] A10 – Insufficient Logging & Monitoring

## 🎯 Goal
By completing and documenting all lessons, I aim to:
- Build strong **offensive security** skills.  
- Gain hands-on experience with OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities.  
- Create a **reference portfolio** of security labs on GitHub.
