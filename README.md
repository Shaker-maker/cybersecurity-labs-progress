# Cybersecurity Labs — Alvin Wainaina

This repository documents my hands-on cybersecurity learning journey as I prepare for a cybersecurity internship (target: May 2026).  
I use the following intentionally vulnerable applications:

- **WebGoat** (OWASP)  
- **DVWA** (Damn Vulnerable Web App)  
- **OWASP Juice Shop**

## Goals
- Document step-by-step lab walkthroughs with commands, screenshots, and lessons learned.
- Build small projects and automation scripts to demonstrate applied skills.
- Keep a professional, searchable portfolio for internship applications.

## Repo structure
- `/WebGoat`, `/DVWA`, `/JuiceShop` — per-lab notes and entries.
- `/resources` — setup instructions, cheatsheets, tools list.
- `.github/workflows` — automated checks (markdown linting).

## How to contribute / use
- Clone: `git clone git@github.com:Shaker-maker/cybersecurity-labs-progress.git`
- Add a lab entry in `/<Lab>/entries/` using `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`.
- Commit with descriptive messages:
  `git add . && git commit -m "WebGoat: added Broken Access Control write-up" && git push`
